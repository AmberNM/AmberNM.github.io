## Semester Project

Students will construct a single application over the duration of the semester and will be delivered in a series of milestones. This simulates a professional software development environment. We will develop in the LAMP environment: Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Emphasis will be on the integration of these components for a useful application; none will be exhaustively covered. We will use git for version control via GitHub and project submission, so the code you generate in the course will serve as a publicly available example of the experience you obtain from the course.
